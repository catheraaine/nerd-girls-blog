# Title of My Post

## Subheadings

This is a paragraph with a [link](url). You can just type a paragraph out like normal. Bold text has **two asterisks** and italic text has *one asterisk*.

More paragraphs are added with single spaces.

An image can be added with an exclamation point in front of the link. We will need to host images locally so just send me a link and I'll do this part ![beautiful leopard](01-init-gwen-weustink-I3C1sSXj1i8-unsplash.jpg).

## Another Heading

### Here's a deeper heading

- Lists use dashes
- You can list lots of stuff

### Other lists

1. Numbered lists are weird
1. You just put "1" on all the points
1. Markdown numbers them correctly
