Hello, world. Well, you did it. You made it through to another month. The grass is green, the trees are leafing out, and flowers are blooming. We Nerd Girls are having our good days and our not-so-good days. We are full of optimism. We are full of despair. We are lonely. We feel like we are part of something greater.

One thing remains constant—we need books more than ever. Which worlds are you escaping to these days? Are you picking up old favorites? Digging into a thousand-page tome you never thought you’d have the time for? Letting a steamy romance whisk you away for a couple hours? Remember: there’s no wrong way to pandemic.

This month we’re going to a place where books themselves come alive in *Sorcery of Thorns* by Margaret Rogerson. Later on, we all sound off about our “auto-buy” authors. Which writers make you say, “Shut up and take my money?”

Read along with our May book club pick, *[Sorcery of Thorns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201395-sorcery-of-thorns)*, and as always, join the discussion on Facebook and follow us on Instagram [@nerdgirlsbookclub](https://www.instagram.com/nerdgirlsbookclub/)!

## May Book Club Pick

From [Simon and Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Sorcery-of-Thorns/Margaret-Rogerson/9781481497619):

<blockquote>
  All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather.

  Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire, and Elisabeth is implicated in the crime. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.

  As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.

Take care of yourself,

The Nerd Girls
